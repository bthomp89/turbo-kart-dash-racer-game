Hi And thanks for your purchase!


This pack includes:


+ 

+ 9 variations of the character set and ready to go. These are prefabs. You can make many more With by adjusting material colors.

+ Blender sourcefile included in Models/Racer.zip (to learn Blender > try blendernation or blendercookie)

+ The Racer and Kart are rigged in blender and can be animated.
	
	For the Racer I made a simple idle, brake, steer right and left, and boost animation
	You can your own driving animations. I suggest to add keys to the elements you would
	like to animate in the driving action and each part of 	the go-kart (wheels and Steer).
	Make one long animation and make clips in unity. Like I did.

	In the sample driving animation the hands are attached with IK to the steer. This is Keyable.
	To export your driving animations select the racer and the all he Kart Parts and export to fbx.
	Choose - Selected only and make sure you put the scale to 100 and include all actions.
	Make sure to export to the Racer.fbx If you want to use the prefabs I made.


+ Playable animated walking demo character using the mecanim system.

+ The "PilotOnlyPLayer" is prefab based on mecanim.

	Includes 3 Idle animations 1 Run, 1 Jump animation.

	You can find various animations in the unity sample files for the playable character.

	You can also make your own with the source files.
	To export your player only animations select the racer mesh and export to fbx.
	Choose - Selected only and make sure you put the scale to 100 and include all actions.
	Make sure to export to the PilotAnimations.fbx If you want to use the prefabs I made.
	In unity you can add the animations via the controller this way.
	

The UV-unwrap is set up so you can easly add decals.
You can also change the colors fairly easy. The photoshop layers are named accordingly.

Enjoy!
